======

This respository contains code for prototypes of time series visualizations of sample hydroshare data. The visualizations arewere developed using JavaScript/D3.js and some other third-party APIs.

Load index.html in your browser to see different types of plots of sample hydroshare data. 

JavaScript code that renders the plots is embedded inside individual html files. External libraries are loaded via web URLs, except for code to generate box plot, which is included in this repository (as file box.js).

Caveat: the plots load data from local CSV files (included in this repository). Integration with hydroshare portal will require customization in form of linking data stream to the plots. 

Best.
